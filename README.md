- 👋 Hi, I’m @oishanik
- 👀 I’m interested in ... deciphering ancient codes, finding the next manga to binge, and caffeine-fueled late-night coding sessions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... photography to capture life's moments, automation to make life easier and the art of making the perfect espresso.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... intergalactic space missions or maybe just some cool open-source projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... oishaniknath@outlook.com (Carrier pigeons are welcome too, but results may vary).
